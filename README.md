# CBS dataset
· Our CBS dataset has now been uploaded to https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DU9MaHUgckmV3tGLRp2Yz6u5i6iAf9U1.

· In the six scenes of the CBS dataset, there are FRF, NRF images, and reference images (GT) corresponding to FRF images. The FRF and NRF images contain five levels of distortion in each scenes. The FRF images are randomly sampled 150 times at each distortion level, the NRF images are randomly sampled 50 times at each distortion level. GT images can be used for rendering NVS scenes, the FRF and NRF images can be used for quality assessment of NVS scenes.

· FRF-MOS and NRF-MOS are the quality scores of images obtained from subjective experiments.

# MTSA model
The MTSA model is being packaged and will be open source soon.
